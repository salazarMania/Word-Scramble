# Word-Scramble
This is a simple app i have constructed using key SwiftUI functions such as Lists, UITextChecker and many more. The game displays a root word. You need to use the letters from the root word to create different words. You will be marked based on the length of the words and the amount of it. This game consists over 10,000 words. Press "Reload" for a new word if you feel bored or stuck . I hope you enjoy the game. 
Kudos ðŸ¥‚
